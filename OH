1. DID between train stations that had coal fields around and that did not. (1800s to 2010s)
> requirement: homogenity of the y variable (economic prosperity)
> parallel assumption check: through comparision of 1851 - 1871


2. DID between continuous coal industry and cities with early closure (Swansea, Wales / Barnsley, England + yorkshrie(?))

>> heavy industries large establishments (metal..) > less enterpreneurships 
vs small industries > bigger enterpreneurships
19th centuries vs 20th centuries 
enterpreneurships are inherited.. and relevant to enterpreneurships
enterpreneurships index? Olmo silva's work 

find out in google scholar "declining of manufacturing in the UK"


3. 
Y - Economic prosperity(number of entrepreneurs / occupational classification)
X - transportation approximity 
IV - slope, 
exclusion of major cities (ONSA), 
geology > for the coal distribution. 


X, Y
num of enterprise + classification of occupation
industrial agglogation (1 level ~ 3 level) >> must be some papers regarding this



Any advice regarding above?

Is there any dataset I can use other than company number for each district?
> if I use occupational classification, can I get to decide the standard for the class?
>> any relevant papers you recommend?

I couldn't find any data that uses geology for such research above. How can I use the dataset?

Any paper for analyzing resource curse within the UK? (I could not find one)



Found facts:
1) RSD - parish - LA: out of 1800 RSDs, 243 RSDs are overlapping between two or more of Local Authorities.  >> need to rule them out or take the majority area of RSD as LA
2) RSD - number of entrepreneurs; LA - number of business (+ productivity/Gross median weekly pay) >> persuade the need of proxy variable (assuming that entrepreneurs and number of business is correlated (any lits?))
3) industrial sectors change
