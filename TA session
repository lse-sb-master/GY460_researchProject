first, we rerun with right parameters... and then if there isn't any difference in between..  

1. covert to right label dataset >> there is no difference between full and ori
>> pros: higher accuracy 
>> cons: added features has no meaning + occurence prediction cannot be used..

2. disregard the 10 time experiment and use the best tuned accuracy only 
>> pros: more narrative
>> cons: fraud



1) we have high accuracy 
2) we suggested our own model (travelnet)
3) concluding new features didn't help much but.. we tried at least
4) occurence accuracy can improved by balancing dataset I suppose...



-----------------agenda---------------
1) drop occurence from the report
2) Improving travelnet > sunbin's trial
3) MLP is only using node features / no point of graph >> try degrading >> omitting >> sunbin's
4) 10 times run > emma report writing



-------------------------------------------------------

1. do not fix the errors and pretend as if we have over 90 percent accuracy >> risk is.. all models are giving similar outputs.. 
2. admit our mistakes and report null accuracy > minwei says "NEVER" >> pass grade 100%


3. run with the corrected code, just report the tunned value (78~80%) without 10 times repetition and without null accuracy >> severity + without reporting null accuracy

-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. run all again with correct codes + new dataset > if.. models are 



-----------------------------------------------------------------

1) bigger dataset works slightly better than the original dataset > it is slight difference but it is consistent across multiple models. 
2) if GGB works better than others..
>> showed potential for further research


agenda:
0) OMIT MLP
1) keep the tone of "displayed potential to improve with bigger dataset and larger computing power (across multiple models)"
2) code integration - 
3) report proof read & integration
4) one more paragraph in model experiment part 
5) one more paragraph for time complexity (+computing complexity) report - Sunbin?
6) feature extraction - angular directional elevational features part - Sunbin?
7) explainable variables - Kon?
